# boilerplate-nextjs-mui

I quickly noticed that each time I started a new nextjs project the setup was relatively time-consuming. Getting eslint and prettier setup working the way I like each time also proved to be a bit of a pain...
So I decided to make myself a boilerplate.

- initial setup using create-next-app
- installation of Material-UI
- configuration for eslint and prettier
